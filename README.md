# Mission-to-Mars

## Project Overview

In this project ,I am utilizing variety of  web scraping tools to create an app that capture information regarding Nasa’s latest article, featured picture, Mars facts and images of Mars Hemispheres from Nasa’s websites in order to build the app.  

#### Following tools was used for this project 
* Splinter              : Elevating the scraping. 
* Beautiful Soup        : Extracts and Capture data
* Chrome Developer Tool : Inspect the website with <code> find_by_" " </code> commands. 
* Python and Pandas     : Creating scraping.py and app.py.
* Flask                 : render the data and create a web application app.py.
* MongoDB               : Store data for the app. Benefit of using MDB is that it can store data without relationships to other data and store it in JSON format. 
* HTML                  : Build the index.html.
* CSS and Bootstrap     : Make the app responsive, user friendly and aesthetic.
